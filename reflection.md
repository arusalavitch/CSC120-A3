Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I worked with the tutors and people in tutoring hours, I don't really remember their names, I should have written them down in hindsight. I think one of them was actually from 110. I worked with Bobi and someone named Alanna I believe.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
   I attended tutoring on Tuesday 2/13 and office hours on 2/20 because I was still having trouble submitting it with github. I'm  
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    I've worked a little with Java before, what's still messing me up is VisualStudio. There's a lot of kinks to work out with pushing and committing to GitHub that I can't seem to figure out. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I think that python is definitely easier to work with, as the punctuation is less specific, but I do like the control that Java gives programmers with preventing different inputs from editing a class by making things private or public or final or whatever. I think that loops also make more sense in java with the way that they are written.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    -Start early. Run a lot of test cases and don't delete anything just comment it out, that way you still have it when the new thing that you written ultimately doesn't work.
